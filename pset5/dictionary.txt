The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. 
The good things don’t always soften the bad things, 
but vice versa the bad things don’t always spoil the good things and make them unimportant

Courage isn't a matter of not being frightened, you know. 
It's being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway.

Some people live more in 20 years than others do in 80.
It's not the time that matters, it's the person.

I am and always will be the optimist.
The hoper of far-flung hopes and the dreamer of improbable dreams.
